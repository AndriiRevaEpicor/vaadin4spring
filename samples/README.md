Vaadin4Spring Samples
=====================

Here, you can find small sample applications that demonstrate different ways of using Spring4Vaadin.

## Event Bus Sample ##

This demonstrates how the Event Bus works and the differences between the different event bus scopes. It also demonstrates
using server push. [Go to the sample](eventbus-sample)

## Navigation Sample ##

This demonstrates how Vaadin4Spring integrates with the Vaadin Navigation API. It also illustrates the differences between using prototype, UI and view scoped views. [Go to the sample](navigation-sample)

## Push Sample ##

This demonstrates how Vaadin4Spring, server-side background threads and server push play together. [Go to the sample](push-sample)

## Security Sample - Managed Security ##

This demonstrates how Spring Security can be used in Vaadin4Spring applications using the managed security approach where Vaadin takes care of the
Spring Security configuration and integration. [Go to the sample](security-sample-managed)

## Security Sample - Shared Security ##

This demonstrates how Spring Security can be used in Vaadin4Spring applications using the shared security approach where Spring Security is configured
and handled outside of the Vaadin application. [Go to the sample](security-sample-shared)

## Sidebar Sample ##

This demonstrates how the Side Bar component can be used to build UIs that are easy to navigate. [Go to the sample](sidebar-sample)
