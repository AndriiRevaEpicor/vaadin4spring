/**
 * Interface defining an event bus. This event bus infrastructure complements the {@link org.springframework.context.ApplicationEventPublisher} in the following ways:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Events propagate from parent buses to children</li>
 * <li>Events are scoped</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * There are three event scopes, and therefore three event bus types:
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@link EventScope#APPLICATION} events are published to the entire application.</li>
 * <li>{@link EventScope#SESSION} events are published to the current session.</li>
 * <li>{@link EventScope#UI} events are published to the current UI.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p/>
 * The event buses are chained in the following way:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Application events are propagated to the session event bus.</li>
 * <li>Session events are propagated to the UI event bus.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Furthermore, {@link org.springframework.context.ApplicationEventPublisher} events are propagated to the application event bus (and further down the chain to the UI event bus).
 * <p/>
 * The primary {@code EventBus} implementation is always UI-scoped and can be injected into your UI classes like this:
 * <code>
 * &#64;Autowired EventBus myUIScopedEventBus;
 * </code>
 * With this implementation, you can subscribe to and publish events of all scopes (see {@link #publish(EventScope, Object, Object)}).
 * <p/>
 * However, if you want to inject any of the other
 * event buses, you have to use the {@link org.vaadin.spring.events.EventBusScope} qualifier. For example, the following code will inject the session event bus:
 * <code>
 * &#64;Autowired &#64;EventBusScope(EventScope.SESSION) EventBus myUIScopedEventBus;
 * </code>
